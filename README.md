# DVD-Rental-data-analysis
This is a self learning project I started using PostgreSQL.
The case we have is large DVD/Movie rental business wants to run promotions and understand their employees interactions with their customers. 
In this project, we try to understand the behavior and demographics of our past customers.
The analysis of customer purchase history will derive the next promotion campaign to acheive the maximum result.
